                <p>Upon entry, the first thing Slick notices is <span class="felt">Sn</span><span style="color: #000000">o</span><span class="felt">wman</span>, half conscious and glaring at him with as much anger as she can muster. Droog stands behind her with a sly smile on his face. “So what do you got that cracked the case open?” Slick asks. “Same thing that you used to try to crack her chest open,” he says, holding a bloody white bullet up in the moonlight. That bullet is from the revolver Slick stole, but why would he take a shot at her now? Before he can think of an answer, Droog intertups with the line “Draw, Spades” and everything starts to become clear. Slick suddenly remembers being in this room setting things up for a card game between the crew, and all of a sudden she pops up and mutters that to taunt him, and he just lost it in a fit of anger. At this point Slick tries to think of a way to defend himself. “What else could I do? The dame asked for it,” was all he could think to say.</p>
