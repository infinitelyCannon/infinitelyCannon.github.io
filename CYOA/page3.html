                <p>Your name is <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#9830;</span>Diamonds Droog. You’re honestly not surprised about this attempted hit. You figured that this was bound to happen but something about this doesn’t add up to you. The members of <span class="felt">the Felt</span> are crazy, time-manipulating morons but even they know better than to pick a fight with her. The only person with a motive to pull this off would be Slick himself as he’s the only one of us with a mutual hatred of <span class="felt">Sn</span><span style="color: #000000">o</span><span class="felt">wman</span>. Even with all this, however, you can’t come and throw him under the bus without some solid proof to keep him there. As the rest of the gang decides to spread out on their own objectives, you consider your hunch telling you to <a href="page11.html">stay and investigate the scene</a>. At the same time, you speculate a bit of value in <a href="page12.html">following Deuce on his search</a>. The guy’s easily distracted, but still gets the job done and might see something you overlooked.</p>
