                <p>Your name is &#9824;Spades Slick. You’re the leader of the Midnight Crew, this gang of nightly mobsters. On any other night you’d be overjoyed to see your nemesis <span class="felt">Sn</span><span style="color: #000000">o</span><span class="felt">wman</span> out cold, but you specifically stated that she was to be the last of <span class="felt">the Felt</span> to go down. Your memory’s a bit hazy regarding the past few hours, so you don’t remember if it was any of your members who did this. Either way, you know for certain that the rest of those time bending lunatics are going to make their way here to recover their teammate. With that in mind, you decide to leave the group and scan the rest of the joint for any felt members.</p>
                <p>A few minutes pass into this search before you spot <span class="felt">Clover</span>. That little green devil is gonna <a href="page6.html">get the business end of your bullet</a> this time. However, knowing how cleverly evasive he is, you ponder for a moment on <a href="page9.html">contacting Boxcars for backup</a>. A set of muscles like him could be all you need.</p>
