Silence, just as you expected out of him. He appears to have already activated his powers over time; the ability to slow the flow of time, but only onto himself. Awaiting an answer, you . . . . . . apparently keep waiting for a long time as <span class="felt">Doze</span>’s lips ever so slightly form the first syllable to what you hope is the answer you’re looking for.</p>
