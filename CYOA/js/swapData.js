It appears she woke up and is now staring daggers at you. Not wanting to deal with an angry broad, you turn your attention to Droog and ask him about his findings. He answers with a smirk on his face and holds up a stained bullet from your revolver. How confusing. You always held a bit of contempt for <span class="felt">Sn</span><span style="color: #000000">o</span><span class="felt">wman</span> but why go to such a risk of pocketing the eighth ball? You have trouble remembering until Droog joggs your memory with the phrase “What are you waiting for? Draw Spades.” It then only takes a second to recall the memory of <span class="felt">Sn</span><span style="color: #000000">o</span><span class="felt">wman</span> sneaking into this room to taunt you with that phrase while you were setting up for your gang’s card game. You glance at her and then at Droog, who looks at you with an expectant glance; perhaps for an explanation for what you did.

Droog might have something you could help with but he appears to be busy dealing with <span class="felt">Sn</span><span style="color: #000000">o</span><span class="felt">wman</span>. You instead ask him for some advice on what to do. He says something about looking out for some interesting hints. Of course, a hint, you think, is exactly what what we need to solve this. With a goal in mind you <a href="page14.html">make your way down the hallway to begin your search</a>.</p>']
