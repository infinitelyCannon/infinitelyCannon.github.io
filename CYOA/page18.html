                <p>You burst into room with a bucket of energy, a declaration of challenge to <span class="felt">Itchy</span> and not much else, certainly not a plan. <span class="felt">Doze</span> attempts to escape, but you focus is on <span class="felt">Itchy</span>. Quicker than a wink, this guy’s time altering abilities allow him to slow the flow of it for everything except himself. Your attempts to get at him through wild flailing are futile and you instead put your dukes up to defend yourself from any punches you won’t see coming. <span class="felt">Itchy</span>, being the unyielding trickster he is, goes for your hat and swaps it for . . . a bowler hat, no a dunce cap, wait no a firefighter’s hat, and now it’s a po- you are currently wearing a joker’s hat right now.</p>
                <p>Clearly unable to keep with <span class="felt">Itchy</span>’s speed, you honestly have no choice but to fall prey to his endless tasks of mischief. The only concern that’s really plaguing your mind is the question of where he is pulling all these new hats from.</p>
