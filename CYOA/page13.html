You head down the hallway looking for Deuce and end up finding him staring intensely at a clock against the wall. “Interesting,” you think. Could there be a blood stain on side of it; a sign of damage to hint at a fight; perhaps it was broken recently by Slick (due to his hatred of clocks) and is stuck on the time of his arrival. You head over to Deuce to see why he's staring and arrive at an unharmed fully functional grandfather clock. You ask him what he’s found, and he replies saying that he found the most beautiful clock he’s ever seen. You resist the urge to facepalm yourself and ask why he decided to focus on this thing. He says that you told him to look for something interesting that stands out; this clock he found fits that description nicely in his opinion. You want to <a href="page16.html">vent out at Deuce to try to clear the misunderstanding</a>, but you think that nothing productive will get done unless you <a href="page11.html">head back to start your investigation</a>.</p>
