                <p>You ignore <span class="felt">Cans</span> and charge straight for <span class="felt">Sawbuck</span>. The moment he sees you, he pulls up his shotgun and cocks it. Wow, the guy was quicker than you thought he’d be. He’s still no match for your strength, and you’re able to easily grab the gun from his fat fingers and render him unarmed. He tries to attack you, and your reflexes lead you to banging him in the head with the but of his gun. You then realize that you may have hit a bit too hard, as a flash appears and dissipates to reveal the inside of some marketplace. Oh wait, as you look around you remember that you had planned to do some grocery shopping next week; your attack must have caused you both to jump further along the timeline. Seeing that this whole <span class="felt">Sn</span><span style="color: #000000">o</span><span class="felt">wman</span> things must have blown over by now, you consider <a href="page23.html">taking care of your business with the store</a>. However duty does still call and <span class="felt">Sawbuck</span> is trying to scramble away from you. Perhaps <a href="page24.html">another swift hit will</a> send you back to your present (or at least some time closer to it than this.)</p>
