                <p>You begin to mention to Deuce that when you said interesting you meant interesting in relation to <span class="felt">Sn</span><span style="color: #000000">o</span><span class="felt">wman</span> being injured, not anything interesting at all. He begins to say that this clock is interesting, itâ€™s awe-inspiring craftsmanship is something that demands attention towards its beauty. Besides <span class="felt">Sn</span><span style="color: #000000">o</span><span class="felt">wman</span> is a member of <span class="felt">the Felt</span>, he figured that because they center around time they could have something special going on with this clock; they could use it to store a set of backup hats in case they lose one in a brawl. You attempt for while to correct Deuce on his reasoning but he just seems so fixated on this clock. It seems you were right about not getting anything productive done.</p>
