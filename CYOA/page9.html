                <p>You call up Boxcars on your radio and tell him to get over here and help you deal with <span class="felt">Clover</span>. He then tells you that he’s too busy handling <span class="felt">Sawbuck</span> and <span class="felt">Cans</span>, but will head over to you as soon as they’re dealt with. Knowing Deuce he’ll probably become too sidetracked with one of <span class="felt">Clover</span>’s riddles if he shows up and Droog is likely deep into some critical investigating right now, smart as he is. You decide to wait for Boxcars and are trying to keep <span class="felt">Clover</span> in your sight when Droog radios you. You pick up whispering “what is it,” softly into your end. He says he’s got something that cracks this case wide open. While you are curious enough about the case to <a href="page10.html">head back to the room <span class="felt">Sn</span><span style="color: #000000">o</span><span class="felt">wman</span> was left in</a>, you still figure it could wait long enough for you to <a href="page6.html">deal with <span class="felt">Clover</span> without Boxcars's help</a>.</p>
