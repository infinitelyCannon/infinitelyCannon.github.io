                <p>You begin to stare in awe at the beauty of this clock. The very craftsmanship of this aged timepiece is magnificent. The rhythmic tick of the pendulum draws you in while the toe molding below it keeps you over. The intricate finish on the clock’s inlay looks amazing; the etchings on the weights take shine boldly with long streaks of brilliant gold light; the moon dial even has a high amount of fidelity marked into it to the point that you can see every nook, cranny, and crater modeled on it; the split pediment stand as proud and true as the king’s guard; and oh lord look at the planton . . .</p>
                <p>You continue on in your admiration of the clock for quite some time. A long enough time for the rest of your fellow gang members to continue and solve the case without your assistance. It was honestly for the best, as you do tend to get sidetracked quite often.</p>
