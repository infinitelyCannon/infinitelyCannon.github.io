                <p>This story was created by Dakarai Simmons. I am an aspiring programmer from Jacksonville. I entered the field of computer science from an interest that began in high school and have been pursing this field into college. My artistic pursuits grew in parallel to my scientific ones. As I was learning to program I used that knowledge as an introduction to computer based art. My understanding of programming continues to develop under the goal of combining the two fields by focusing on art works that depend on or expose a property of mathematics. On the other side of the coin I also have the goal of exposing a visual side of the vasts of amount of logic and data programmers are expected to have computers manipulate. It is this latter goal that has lead me to switch to the field of Game Design I'm currently studying. The switch in majors now represents a decision to switch from strictly scientific software engineering to a field that offers knowledge on how to better design the experience of using and creating software.</p>
