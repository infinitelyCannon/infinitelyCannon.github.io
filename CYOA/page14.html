                <p>You wander around the hallway with these instructions bouncing around in your mind. So far there appears to be nothing of the sort in this place. You turn a corner and low and behold the bounty of interesting wonders before you. In a room down the hall you spot two Felt members <span class="felt">Itchy</span> and <span class="felt">Doze</span> conversing with each other. Given the handfull these two can be on their own, you figure the best move is to handle either <a href="page18.html" style="color: #2ed73a;">Itchy</a> or <a href="page17.html" style="color: #2ed73a;">Doze</a> individually. However, as you inch closer towards the room, you find it increasingly hard to ignore the sight of a lovely looking grandfather clock happily ticking away against the wall beside you. Droog did say something about looking into anything interesting and everyone of these three things catch your eye. Perhaps it could be worth it to <a href="page15.html">give the clock a look</a>, if only for a minute.</p>
