                <p>You close in on <span class="felt">Sn</span><span style="color: #000000">o</span><span class="felt">wman</span> and take a serious look at her. She’s wounded, but not faitaly, her blue blood forming a deeply dark stain on her coat. Your inspection of the wound gives the impression of more of a bullet wound than a stabbing. Judging by the location the person aiming missed a shot at her heart and instead got her in the shoulder. Curious, you reach inside and try to carefully feel around inside the wound and immediately spot a round bullet in contact with her bone. You pull it out as carefully as you can and are surprised to see that the bone appears to be perfectly mildly damaged. You realize that this bullet belongs to Slick’s handgun while <span class="felt">Sn</span><span style="color: #000000">o</span><span class="felt">wman</span> starts to grab you by the leg. “That hurt you bastard,” she strains to say to you. You tell her to save her strength and be quick about telling you who did this. She takes a deep breath, deciding to make this brief. “What are waiting for? Draw, Spades.” You don’t know the context behind all this, but with this bullet it’s all you need. You immediately decide to <a href="page10.html">call over Slick and tell him you’ve cracked this case</a>.</p>
