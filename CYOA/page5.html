                <p>Your name is &#9829;Hearts Boxcars. Your amazing strength and <s>not much else</s> your no nonsense attitude has earned you a valued spot in the Midnight Crew. You think much too highly of your crewmates to suspect any of them had anything to do with <span class="felt">Sn</span><span style="color: #000000">o</span><span class="felt">wman</span>’s condition. If any of <span class="felt">the Felt</span> members were involved, you figure it had to involve some time shenanigans of two of their largest members; and <a href="page19.html">you know exactly where to find them</a>. These are some grade A eggs to crack (other than their twelveth member <span class="felt">Eggs</span> but that’s a another story) and you might want to <a href="page20.html">check your inventory to measure up your chances</a>.</p>
