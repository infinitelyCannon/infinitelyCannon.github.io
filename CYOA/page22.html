                <p>With the promise of a mighty good brawl in your reach, you charge towards <span class="felt">Cans</span> and round up your fist for a suckerpunch on his leg. As you rush past <span class="felt">Sawbuck</span>, he fumbles with his gun in shock and tries to hurry with his next round of bullets.

He must not have heard him you figure. You get within a foot of <span class="felt">Cans</span>, but before you can even lay a dent on him he snaps around and clocks you in the face; hard enough to <a href="page19.html">send you back in time few minutes prior</a>.</p>
